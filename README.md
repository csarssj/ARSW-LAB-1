## Part I - Introduction to threads in JAVA

1. In agreement with the lectures, complete the classes CountThread, so that they define the life cycle of a thread that prints the numbers between A and B on the screen.
2. Complete the main method of the CountMainThreads class so that: 
	- Create 3 threads of type CountThread, assigning the first interval [0..99], the second [99..199], and the third [200..299]. 
	- Start the three threads with start(). Run and check the output on the screen. 
	- Change the beginning with start() to run(). How does the output change? Why?
