Accordingly, and using the game logic, identify and write clearly (ANSWERS.txt file)
1. Possible race conditions
	When two snakes eat a mouse at the same time
	When two snakes take a power  at the same time
	Probability when two or more snakes pass through the same cell
2. An incorrect or inappropriate use of collections, considering its concurrent handling(For this increase the game speed and execute it multiples times until an error has been raised).
	Using linkedlist throws a "ConcurrentModificationException" error and is possibly not the best solution for handling concurrency
3. Unnecessary use of active waits
	wait for the snakes to die
